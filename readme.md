# Assignments

-   [x] Put your project proposal in a document called project-proposal.md. You
    should refine this to clarify your plan and what you want your project to
    accomplish.

Your project should:

-   [x] Put a link to your Deepnote repository where you did the work in the
    readme.md, and make sure to give Prof. Kitchin edit access to it.
-   [x] solve a practical problem that is not too trivial, and that a reusable
    package would be helpful for.
-   [x] be pip installable
-   [x] have a License
-   [ ] have a readme.md file that explains what it is, and how to use it. If you
    have a command line utility, there should be examples of how to use it, and
    the output. If your package is for a notebook you should provide an example
    notebook, including data if it is needed.
-   [x] Should pass black, flake8 and pylint (ideally you would setup pre-commit
    hooks to help ensure this)
-   [ ] Should have some tests that are run in a GitHUB action, and your project
    should pass them.

You should put your project code in a directory called `src`. You can name your
project anything you want inside of that.

I am more interested in seeing a good, well-documented solution to a single
problem than lots of partial, undocumented solutions to many problems. You can
always add things to it after things are working right.
