# 06682 PROJECT PROPOSAL

## WEATHER FORECAST AND CONVERSION

In this project, I propose to create a python package to retrieve weather data for the ZIP Code provided by the user. The weather data will be retrieved from http://wttr.in/:help as a JSON.
It would display the current temperature, ‘feels like’ temperature in Fahrenheit along with weather description.
The temperatures will then be converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius using a function. Then emojis will be displayed based on the range of current temperature that was converted to Celsius units.
Tests will be created for a valid zip code. It will be formatted using black, and will pass flake8/ pylint style checks.

The timeline of the project will be as follows:
Retrieve data and write package: 2 hrs
Create tests: 2 hrs
Formatting and Managing on Github: 2 hrs
The project is expected to be completed by 29 April.
